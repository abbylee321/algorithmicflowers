# Intergalatic Garden

In this intergalactic garden, users can create their own garden in space. Users are initially brought to a garden of flowers, moving in random fluid motions. They can mouse over flowers with attributes they like, evolving the garden to have more of these particular attributes. This project uses a genetic algorithm to take into account usersâ€™ preferences so they evolve a garden to their liking.
